# 🎣 GPO Autofish - GUIDE

**💬 Join our Discord server:** https://discord.gg/unPZxXAtfb

## What is this?

This is the **open-source version** of the GPO fishing macro that everyone uses. Unlike the closed-source version that gets flagged as a virus and isn't trustworthy, this version is:

- ✅ **Fully open source** - You can see and verify all the code
- ✅ **No viruses** - Clean, transparent, and safe
- ✅ **Improved** - Better features and reliability
- ✅ **Community-driven** - Open for contributions and review

The original closed-source macro is sketchy and often flagged by antivirus software because you can't verify what it's actually doing. This open-source version solves that problem.

**🛡️ Concerned about safety? Read [IS_IT_A_VIRUS.md](IS_IT_A_VIRUS.md) for more information.**

## 🎮 Quick Start Guide

### First Time Setup

1. Run `install.bat` to set everything up
2. Launch with `run.bat` (shows console) or `run_silent.bat` (hidden)
3. Position the detection overlay over your fishing bar
4. Configure settings in the GUI (webhook, auto-purchase, etc.)

### For Long Sessions (9+ hours)

- Use `run_silent.bat` for best performance
- Disable "Verbose Console Logging" in settings
- Enable Discord webhook to track progress remotely

### Hotkeys

- **F1**: Start/Stop fishing
- **F2**: Toggle auto-purchase
- **F3**: Emergency stop
- **Note**: Hotkeys work without admin privileges

### Performance Tips

- Silent mode uses less CPU and memory
- Turn off verbose logging for smoother operation
- Use webhook notifications instead of watching console

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

- **"Python not found"**: Download from https://python.org and check "Add to PATH"
- **"pip not recognized"**: Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
- **Permission errors**: Right-click `install.bat` → "Run as administrator"

### Runtime Issues

- **Hotkeys not working**: Try running the macro with administrator
- **Detection not working**: Adjust overlay position and detection settings
- **High CPU usage**: Use silent mode (`run_silent.bat`) and disable verbose logging

### Performance Issues

- **Long sessions lagging**: Use `run_silent.bat` instead of `run.bat`
- **Console spam**: Uncheck "Verbose Console Logging" in GUI
- **Memory usage**: Silent mode automatically reduces memory footprint
