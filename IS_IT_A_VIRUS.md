# 🛡️ Is This a Virus?

## No, it's not a virus.

This project is **100% open source** and all code is visible in this repository. You can inspect every line of code yourself.

### Security Transparency

- ✅ **Fully open source** - All code is publicly available
- ✅ **No network calls** - The code doesn't send data anywhere
- ✅ **No data collection** - Nothing is tracked or recorded
- ✅ **Local operations only** - Everything runs on your computer
- ✅ **No obfuscation** - Code is readable and clear

### What the code actually does:

1. Captures your screen to detect fishing minigame colors
2. Automates mouse clicks to control the fishing bar
3. Records click positions you manually set for auto-purchasing
4. All operations are completely local to your machine

### Still not sure?

**If you don't feel safe about the installation process, you can:**

- 📖 **Read the source code** - Check `z.py` yourself
- 🤖 **Ask an AI** - Have ChatGPT, Claude, or another AI analyze the code
- 👨‍💻 **Ask a developer friend** - Have someone with programming experience review it
- 🔍 **Use VirusTotal** - Scan the files with multiple antivirus engines

### Why does Windows flag it?

Some antivirus software may flag automation tools because they:

- Use global keyboard hooks (for hotkeys)
- Control mouse movements
- Capture screen content

**This is normal for game automation tools.** The code is open for you to verify there's nothing malicious.

### Running as Administrator

## Most Macros ask for the privilage to run as administrator, This macro does not do such.

**When in doubt, always verify the code yourself or ask someone you trust to review it.**
